Introduction:
The code is a simulation of the trick two red queens. I tried to convert a real world problem into code so I can solve it computationally.

Summary of trick:
The trick revolves around a deck of cards where two red queens are removed initially. We then take 13 random cards, after shuffling we take a random card. We place that card again on top of deck and keep shuffling. We then take the two red queens which we removed before and place either on top and end of deck. 
Then we would spell BETWEEN and with each letter take a card from deck and place it, and keep doing it until N and then put those cards again on the deck.
We would do the same for THE, TWO, RED, QUEENS.
After this,we spread the cards out and there is our card between the two red queens

Results:
The result can be shown that the chosen random card is between the two queens card.
